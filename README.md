# DMRF-2.0
Delhi Metro Route Finder

## BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT PROJECT:
The Delhi Metro is a mass rapid transit system serving Delhi and its satellite cities. It is by far the largest and busiest metro rail system in India. The network consists of 11 colour coded lines serving 255 stations in Delhi with a total length of 348 kilometers. Since it is widely spread, a person constantly needs to change metro lines to reach the destination station. Our project helps a person find the route required to reach the destination. DMRF is a program developed in C++ that helps a person to find a route to the destination entered. It also finds the total fare, average time and number of stations in the journey. It uses concepts of graphs, vectors, file handling and graphics (UI).

## FEATURES OF THE PROJECT:
- Shortest route between two stations,
- Stations in between the two stations,
- Changes in line shown using colours,
- Average fare,
- Average time,
- Number of stations,
- Route with an intermediate station

## CONCEPTS USED:
-DMRF is a program developed in C++ in which a user enters the starting station and end station.
-The program uses various concepts of DSA with an interactive UI in C++.
-The program is made by applying the concepts of graphs, vectors, file handling, etc.
